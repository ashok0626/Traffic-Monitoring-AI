This project focuses on developing a real-time traffic monitoring system using artificial intelligence techniques. 
The system is designed to detect, track, and analyze vehicles in video feeds, providing valuable data for road safety and traffic management.

Using YOLOv8 for object detection, OpenCV for video processing, and Python for system orchestration, this project enables accurate vehicle tracking and speed estimation.
